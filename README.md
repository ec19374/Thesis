# Thesis - "Predicting Successful Searches Among Muslim Users of Matrimonial Websites and Apps Using Machine Learning"

This repo consists of 2 raw .csv files that I cleaned already, one has NaNs and the other has zeros in those spaces. The NaN file is used for the XGBoost component of my Jupyter Notebook source code.
This repo also consists of 2 source codes, one is a cleaned version and the other is a messy one that shows how much work I put into this project.
